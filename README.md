# CCDATSCL_PROJECT_COM222

** Project Overview **											
This project aims to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient will attend or miss a scheduled pediatric therapy session by analyzing operational clinic data, such as appointment schedules, payment histories, and patient demographics, combined with external factors like local weather events and Philippine holidays. The study is particularly meaningful as it turns routine administrative records into actionable insights that can help reduce revenue loss and improve therapist utilization in a real clinical setting. Through this work, the project seeks to identify the strongest predictors of non-attendance, comparing financial determinants (such as down payments) with environmental influences, and uncovering specific high-risk appointment profiles that are more prone to cancellations.											
																						
** Research Objectives	**										
											
Primary Objective											
To develop a binary classification model that accurately predicts the probability of patient "No-Shows" (cancellations or absences) in a pediatric therapy clinic by analyzing historical appointment data, payment behaviors, and external environmental factors.											
																						
Secondary Objectives											
1. To determine the effect of financial commitment variables such as down payments and updated payment status on the likelihood of appointment adherence.
2. To examine the statistical influence of environmental and temporal factors including government-declared holidays, typhoon signal warnings, and time-of-day scheduling, on patient attendance rates.
3. To identify demographic risk patterns by analyzing whether factors such as age, clinical diagnosis, or geographic distance from the clinic are significantly associated with cancellation frequencies.
4. To quantify and rank predictor importance using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in order to determine which categories of variables (financial, environmental, or demographic) exert the strongest influence on patient attendance outcomes.
