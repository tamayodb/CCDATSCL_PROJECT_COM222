# CCDATSCL_PROJECT_COM222

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a binary classification model that predicts whether a patient will attend or miss a scheduled pediatric therapy session. The model utilizes operational clinic data—such as appointment schedules, payment histories, and patient demographics—combined with external variables including local weather events and official Philippine holidays.

By transforming routine administrative records into actionable insights, the study helps reduce revenue loss and improve therapist utilization. It also aims to identify the strongest predictors of non-attendance, compare the effects of financial versus environmental factors, and uncover high-risk appointment profiles that are more prone to cancellations.

## **Research Objectives**

### **Primary Objective**
- **To develop a binary classification model** that predicts the likelihood of patient no-shows using historical appointment data, financial behaviors, and environmental factors.

### **Secondary Objectives**
1. **Financial Commitment Analysis**  
   Determine how financial variables—such as down payments and updated payment status—affect appointment adherence.

2. **Environmental & Temporal Factors**  
   Examine how government-declared holidays, typhoon warnings, and appointment time-of-day influence attendance rates.

3. **Demographic Risk Patterns**  
   Identify whether age, diagnosis type, or residential distance from the clinic are associated with higher cancellation frequencies.

4. **Predictor Importance Ranking**  
   Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify and rank which variable categories (financial, environmental, or demographic) most strongly influence attendance outcomes.
